# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome! This is your central hub for understanding how OctoAcme manages projects from idea to delivery. Whether you're new to the team or looking to refresh your knowledge, you'll find everything you need to contribute effectively to our project management practices.

## Overview

OctoAcme employs a structured and iterative approach to project management designed to maximize customer value, ensure quality, and foster collaboration. The project lifecycle begins with a rigorous initiation phase, including problem definition, stakeholder alignment, and drafting a project one-pager. Planning turns ideas into an actionable backlog with clear acceptance criteria, effort estimates, and mapped dependencies. Execution is managed via project boards and regular standups, tracking progress and surfacing blockers, while releases follow a checklist ensuring acceptance, CI, and stakeholder communication.

Key roles include Project Manager (delivery & stakeholder communication), Product Manager (problem definition, prioritization, outcomes), and Developers (deliver features, quality). Quality assurance is embedded at every stage, with requirements for automated and manual testing, security, and review. Risks are identified early and managed in a risk register, with regular communication cadences to keep all parties aligned and proactive escalation paths for issues.

Communication is built into the process: daily standups, weekly syncs, monthly updates, and standardized status templates ensure alignment and transparency. After each delivery cycle, retrospectives are held to capture lessons, assign improvement actions, and measure process impact. This focus on continuous improvement and psychological safety drives consistent, high-quality project delivery at OctoAcme.
